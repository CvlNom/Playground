          <li>
            The main cause of the feedibility came from contact tip by the
            electrical property between contact tip and wire.
          </li>
          <li>
            Because of small section area of wire compare to the contact tip and
            electrical cable from the weld, there are huge amounts of heat
            generated from wire and with small stop of wire movement, wire
            burned out.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Also unstable contact between contact tip and wire, there are lots
            of electrical sparks which make extra heat and worse case the wire
            welded to the contact tip blocking wire feed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Because of huge temperature inside tip, small particles of metal
            from the wire surface melted and gather to the contact point of wire
            and tip so build bigger metal debris resulting wire jamming.

            Contact surface should be cleaned and smooth both contact tip and
            wire surface.

              <li>
                Expensive contact tip last more and make high productivity

              <li>
                The surface of above tip was polished for better electrical
                contacts

            Better drawing practice - Smooth and clean wire surface
            <ul className="list-decimal pl-14 py-2 text-base text-slate-700 mb-2">
              <li>Reduce metal to metal contact as much as possible.</li>
              <li>
                In case of using rich lubricant, could reduce metal to metal
                contacts but hard to clean wire surface after drawing.
              </li>
              <li>
                This is why UB process introduced CRD drawing process and
                mechanical cleaning devices.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cleaning device remove drawing lubricants and also metal debris
                from wire surface.

            Apply Release Agent - Seperate wire from contact tip
            <ul className="list-decimal pl-14 py-2 text-base text-slate-700 mb-2">
              <li>
                Even with better surface of tip and wire, there is electrical
                sparks between wire and tip making local welding that the wire
                attached to the tip.
              </li>
              <li>
                There is another property of lubricant is release character so
                called a release agent which is the graphite at the casting
                factory in order not to attach melted metal to the mould sand.
              </li>
              <li>
                The best release agent is MoS2, PTFE, Graphic and fatty acid.
                (Actually lubricant itself is a release agent)
